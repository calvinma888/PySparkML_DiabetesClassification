<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are two types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes (which is when the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the body) develops early in life, and Type 2 diabetes (which is when the body develops insulin resistance) usually develops gradually over time due to lifestyle-related factors. Type 2 diabetes may be reversed through diet, weight loss, or exercise, and therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease is crucial.

Type 2 diabetes can have numerous indicating factors including pregnancy, blood glucose level, skin thickness, insulin resistance, BMI, age, and many more. However, because oftentimes these symptoms develop slowly, they may be difficult to recognize. Therefore, we utilize PySpark ML in order to train a model to classify whether or not a patient has diabetes, with a resulting Area Under the Curve of 0.8412.
